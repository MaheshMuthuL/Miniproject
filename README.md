## Title of the Project
*AI-Based Law Inquiry Chatbot*
This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer queries related to legal topics, particularly focusing on the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The chatbot leverages the Llama model and FAISS vector store to implement a question-answering (QA) system. It processes legal PDF documents to generate embeddings, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval of information in response to user queries. By combining advanced language modeling with vector-based search, the chatbot ensures precise and context-aware answers tailored to users' legal inquiries.

## About
This project is an advanced AI-driven chatbot designed to address legal inquiries, with a specific focus on providing accurate and context-aware responses based on the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It adapts a framework originally developed for a medical chatbot and tailors it to the legal domain.

## Features
* Domain-Specific Expertise: Unlike general-purpose chatbots, this system is specialized in the legal domain, making it an ideal tool for law students, legal professionals, or individuals seeking clarity on IPC-related matters.
* Real-Time Response: Provides instant answers to user queries, leveraging the power of embeddings and vector search for high-speed performance.
* Expandable Knowledge Base: The chatbot can be updated with additional legal documents or amendments, ensuring it remains relevant over time.

## Requirements
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks and libraries.
* Development Environment: Python 3.8 or later is necessary for coding and executing the chatbot system.
* Deep Learning Framework: Hugging Face's transformers library is used for integrating the Llama model for embeddings and response generation.
* Vector Search Library: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is required for implementing the vector store and similarity search.
* PDF Processing Libraries: Libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber are essential for extracting text from legal PDF documents.
* Frontend Development: Use Streamlit or Gradio to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
* Data Processing Tools: Includes pandas and numpy for efficient data management and numerical operations.
* Version Control: Git is recommended for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or PyCharm can be used as the Integrated Development Environment for coding and debugging.
* Pre-trained Model: Llama model (downloaded from Hugging Face or another trusted source) is required for embedding generation and inference.
* Hardware Requirements:
   * Minimum 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended for smooth performance).
* Additional Dependencies: Includes transformers, faiss-cpu/faiss-gpu, sentence-transformers, pandas, streamlit, and scikit-learn.
